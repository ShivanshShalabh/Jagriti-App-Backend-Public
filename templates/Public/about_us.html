        What is the aim of Jagriti App?
    </div>

    <ul class="content">
        <li>Jagriti App is developed with the main idea of spreading awareness among the economically
            weaker
            section of the
            society
            about what the government policies are for them so that they can develop with the help of these schemes and
            programmes
            which in turn help in countryâ€™s overall development.</li>
        <li>The platform also serves as an aid for people who are deprived of resources and a platform
            where
            people can donate
            essential goods.</li>
        <li>We also want the app to be a solution to many other social problems and for that, we will
            keep on
            adding new features to
            the app.</li>
